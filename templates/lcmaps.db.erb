# lcmaps.db
#
# This file is used to configure lcmaps, but it might be slightly
# confusing at first glance because it's configured differently when
# you use glexec (usually on worker nodes) and when you configure
# services to use lcmaps for mapping users.
#
# In general, you need to modify up to three portions of this file
# unless you are doing unusual advanced configurations.
#
# 1) The gumsclient module definition (in Section 1)
#    This is where you configure the GUMS host you are using. This is
#    true for both glexec and lcmaps for a service. (Ditto for the SAZ
#    host in the sazclient.)
# 2) The glexectracking module (in Section 1)
#    If you are using glexec, uncomment the glexectracking module
#    definition and edit appropriately. You should always uncomment
#    this for glexec but should always leave it commented if you haven't
#    installed glexec.
# 3) glexec mapping policy (in Section 2)
#    You should select the proper policy for glexec, if you are using glexec.
#    Most sites will use the first policy.

#
# Mapping policies
#
# Each of these define how lcmaps is used in different scenarios.
#
# For the authorize_only mapping, the default policy is generally good
# but we have supplied a couple of options in comments.
#
# We've left the various glexec policies commented out--you need to
# choose one of the three policies (because otherwise it causes a
# package dependency problem). Most sites will use the first policy
# (verify proxy, gums client, glexectracking). There is no need to
# uncomment the glexec policies if you are not using glexec.
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# Mapping policy: globus_gridftp_mapping
# Purpose:        Used for gridftp
#
globus_gridftp_mapping:
#Uncomment this one line to add SAZ
#sazclient -> gumsclient
gumsclient -> posix_enf


#
# Mapping policy: osg_default
# Purpose:        Used for the Globus gatekeeper
#
osg_default:
verifyproxy -> gumsclient
#Uncomment the next two lines and comment the previous line to add SAZ
#verifyproxy -> sazclient
#sazclient -> gumsclient


#
# Mapping policy: authorize_only
# Purpose: Used for the programs that only want authorization and don't
# 	want lcmaps to do anything else for them.  This is good for most
#	applications that use globus as their interface to lcmaps.
#

## If the default policy isn't what you want, pick another one.  Make
## sure that only one authorize_only policy is uncommented--the other
## policies should be commented out. For example, if you want policy #2,
## put a hash mark before the first "gumsclient" line and remove the hash
## mark on two lines: just before "sazclient" and just before the next
## "gumsclient".

authorize_only:

## Policy 1: GUMS but not SAZ (most common, default)
gumsclient -> good | bad

## Policy 2: GUMS & SAZ
#sazclient -> gumsclient

## Policy 3: grid-mapfile
#gridmapfile -> good | bad


#
# Mapping policy: glexec
# Purpose:        Used for glexec on the worker nodes.
#
glexec:

## If you use glexec, pick an appropriate policy from the ones below.
## Make sure that only one policy is uncommented.

## Policy 1: GUMS but not SAZ (most common)
verifyproxy -> gumsclient
gumsclient -> condor_updates
condor_updates -> mount_under_scratch
mount_under_scratch -> tracking

## Policy 2: GUMS & SAZ
#verifyproxy -> sazclient
#sazclient -> gumsclient
#gumsclient -> glexectracking

## Policy 3: grid-mapfile
#verifyproxy -> gridmapfile
#gridmapfile -> glexectracking
